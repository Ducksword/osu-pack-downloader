Once running it will prompt you to insert your songs folder path
Simply navigate to your osu! folder and open your songs folder
On the top bar you can right click and copy address to text, then paste that into powershell
It will then ask you to insert the starting number of the beatpacks you want to download (ex. 100)

# Important Notes
The downloader piggy backs off of kitsu.moe
Because of this it is not fast in any stretch of the imagination
HIGHLY RECOMMEND if downloading massive amounts of beatpacks to have a stable internet connection
